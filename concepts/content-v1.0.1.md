# Dev Lucas v1.0.1

Hi, I'm Lucas and I design and build function and  experience on the web 

*btn - What does this mean?*

I love discussing, playing with and solving problems of all shape size and impact. Shipping it then coming back and improving it. My todo list is life long and I wouldn't have it any other way. I am known to bounce dance in my chair when I hit that dark souls flow state and get some real head way on of challenge I have been ruminating about.

What I like.

- making it beautiful
- making it scale for the first time experiencer, and the long time enthusiast and coming up with creative explicative for products and companies that don't do this cough (Microsoft)

A functional dig



I love workflow. Hoping into an  *ecosystem*(add link on hover def) and having the freedom to come up with optimizations for my stakeholders. Where this is exploring what a brand stands for and how those core values manifest into a web presences, blog posts answering the pain points of customers that develop our authority as market leaders.  is what I live for
