# Dev Lucas v1.0.1

Hi, I'm Lucas and I design and build function and  experience on the web 

*btn - What does this mean?*

I love discussing, playing with and solving problems of all shape size and impact. Shipping it then coming back and improving it. My todo list is life long and I wouldn't have it any other way. I am known to bounce dance in my chair when I hit that dark souls flow state and get some real head way on of challenge I have been ruminating about.

What I like.

- making it scale for the first time experiencer, and the long time enthusiast and coming up with creative explicative for products and companies that don't do this cough (Microsoft)

Where this is exploring what a brand stands for and how those core values manifest into a web presences, blog posts answering the pain points of customers that develop our authority as market leaders.  is what I live for
