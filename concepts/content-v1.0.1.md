# Dev Lucas v1.0.1

Hi, I'm Lucas and I design and build function and  experience on the web 

*btn - What does this mean?*

I love discussing, playing with and solving problems of all shape size and impact. Shipping it then coming back and improving it. My todo list is life long and I wouldn't have it any other way. I am known to bounce dance in my chair when I hit that dark souls flow state and get some real head way on of challenge I have been ruminating about.

What I like.

- making it beautiful
- making it scale for the first time experiencer, and the long time enthusiast and coming up with creative explicative for products and companies that don't do this cough (Microsoft)

A functional dig



I love workflow. Hoping into an  *ecosystem*(add link on hover def) and having the freedom to come up with optimizations for my stakeholders. Where this is exploring what a brand stands for and how those core values manifest into a web presences, blog posts answering the pain points of customers that develop our authority as market leaders.  is what I live for

Web and app designing.

Optimized design, 

My design process could be called optimized design or if I am being jargony agile design. I use design as a augmentation or a lubricate for use. 



Creativity is the application of elements in a new way 

 I find data-driven solutions. I use a diversity of skills and tenacity for rigorous understanding to find optimizations within constrained business environments. My academic study of maths and economics has disposed me toward the analytic. This augmented with a strong understanding of web-based technologies centered around JavaScript development stacks and most recently extending into a Python based data analytics and for business intelligence.  My history within various verticles and an aptitude for data enable me to deliver consistent market intelligence.

There is nothing I enjoy more than immersing myself in a system and touching every aspect, finding all of the different flavors of efficient solutions.   The latest system from a long list is marketing data analytics.
